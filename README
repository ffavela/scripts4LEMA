A set of scripts for analysing the fsires files that are given by the
mass spectrometer. The shell script "fsiresParser.sh" parses only the
table data for each fsires file and for each "Sample Id" it creates a
txt file with all the respective runs in different blocks of data (in
ascending order with respect of the fsires file). It also outputs an
average file.

The "plottingScript.sh" plots the txt files including the average files.

This set of scripts were written for helping students analizing files
given by the Laboratorio de Espectrometr√≠a de Masas con Aceleradores
(LEMA) in Mexico.
